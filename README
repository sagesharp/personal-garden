This repo contains my personal garden plans for starting seeds, transplanting,
thinning, and harvesting.  Please fork this, and enjoy your salads.

The wacky csv files are meant to be fed into the src/plants.c program from
https://github.com/sarahsharp/GardenGeek/.  It will spit out plain text or
ical format for the garden calendar.

I live in Portland, Oregon.  You probably want to modify this plan if you live
elsewhere.
